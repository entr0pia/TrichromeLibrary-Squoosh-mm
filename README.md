# TrichromeLibrary-Squoosh

Remove the outdated TrichromeLibrary. **Root Privilege Required**

## Description

As we know, Google uses TrichromeLibrary to share the same code in Chrome and Webview on Android Q+ devices to save space on the device. The Play Store will automatically install the corresponding TrichromeLibrary version when installing and upgrading Chrome and Webview, but will not uninstall the old version.

It is known that the corresponding version of TrichromeLibrary can be uninstalled through the command ```pm uninstall com.google.android.trichromelibrary_$version```, so you can manually uninstall the version number of TrichromeLibrary. Unfortunately, Android does a poor job of shared library management. TrichromeLibrary cannot be displayed in the application list like a normal application (because it is a shared library), nor can use `adb shell pm list libraries` to query installed libraries version on the device.

Since each Android application will have its own directory under ```/data/app```, as shown in the figure below, and the folder name of TrichromeLibrary will also append the version number, so we can search for keywords, and then extract the version number from the results. However, root access is required to access ```/data/app```.

## Fallback

If your device is not rooted, you can use this repo: [TrichromeLibrary_Remover](https://github.com/Undefined-User/TrichromeLibrary_Remover). But you need to make some changes to adapt to the new version of TrichromeLibrary.
